# Metadata for data and code files

## Data files
The survival data is split between files for wood frogs (Rana sylvatica = Rasy) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum = Amma). 

For each species, we include separate files for survival and behavior. For spotted salamanders, we include data on foraging rate, and for wood frogs, we include data on morphology.

Each file includes metadata on the meanings of column names.

Column names and explanations:

## Code
We include STAN files for the code used to test survival using either the Cox or Weibull models.
